# Numenera Character Record

An editable character sheet for Numenera on the web!
There is no backend for the app. The character sheet
data is saved to your browser's storage.

## Motivation

I wanted to practice React + TypeScript and wanted
a flexible Numenera character sheet.

## 3rd Party Libraries (besides React)
