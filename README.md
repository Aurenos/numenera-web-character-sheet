# Numenera Character Record

An editable character sheet for Numenera on the web!
There is no backend for the app. The character sheet
data is saved to your browser's storage.

## Motivation

I wanted to practice React + TypeScript and wanted
a flexible Numenera character sheet.

## To Do

- Add confirmation for sheet reset (maybe also for collection item deletion)

## 3rd Party Libraries (besides React)

- [ts-pattern](https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern) âœ¨
